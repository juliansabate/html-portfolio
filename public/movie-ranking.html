<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Faction is a masterpiece of story telling and writing. The characters and dialogue in this movie are classic, and the soundtrack for the film is spectacular.</p>
<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
<p>Wes Anderson's style is so iconic. I love the cinematography and the artistic style of this movie. The acting and writing are completely unique, and Ralph Phinnes delivers an iconic performance.</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>Arrival by Dennis Villanuve is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. It tackles complicated science fiction concepts but my favorite aspect of the movie is the emotional story of a mother.</p>
